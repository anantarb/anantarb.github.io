Hi, I am Ananta. I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.uni-bielefeld.de">Bielefeld University</a> (<a href="https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/technische-fakultaet/arbeitsgruppen/visual-ai/">Visual AI for Extended Reality Lab</a> led by <a href="https://helge.rhodin.de">Prof. Helge Rhodin</a>). I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.tum.de">TU Munich</a> advised by <a href="https://www.niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html">Prof. Matthias Niessner</a> and <a href="https://seva100.github.io/">Artem Sevastopolsky</a>. Alongside my Master's studies, I was fortunate to work with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-michael-lebacher-625a7b159/?originalSubdomain=de">Dr. Michael Lebacher</a> and <a href="https://mlo-lab.github.io/author/florian-buettner/">Prof. Florian Buettner</a> on Explainable AI at <a href="https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html">Siemens AG</a>.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Jacobs University Bremen. During my Bachelor's, I spent a term abroad at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I did independent research under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/">Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov</a>.

I'm interested in working at the intersection of 3D computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning.
